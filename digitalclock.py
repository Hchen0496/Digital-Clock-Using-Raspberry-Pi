#from each number in a single call, this saves us having to run two concurrent loops.
#In a two-digit number, we use a division by 10 to retrieve the first number. 
#For example we use the # 12, we would get 1 from a division by 10.
#To get the second digit we make use of modulus which returns us the remainder from a division, 
#so in this case from our previous selection for 12 we will get the return of 2.

#out of every number with our RGB values. We achieve this by just checking whether
#there is a number 0 or 1 inside that index. If itâ€™s 0 we output our empty variable value
#to that number. Otherwise, we check to see if we are dealing with the first 32 pixels 
#(which is the top half of the LED matrix), if we are in the top half we grab the RGB values 
#from our hourColor variable. Otherwise, we utilize the RGB values from the minuteColor variable.
